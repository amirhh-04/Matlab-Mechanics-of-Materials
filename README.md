### Engineering Computations Repository
This repository serves as a comprehensive hub for various engineering computational problems, featuring MATLAB solutions and educational content. It is organized into four main directories:

---

# 1. Mechanics of Materials - Computer Problems
- This section includes MATLAB solutions for computer problems related to the study of mechanics of materials.
- Solutions are derived from the 7th edition of the "Mechanics of Materials" book by Ferdinand P. Beer, E. Russell Johnston, Jr., John T. Dewolf, David F. Mazurek.

# 2. Numerical Calculations - Analysis
- Here, you'll find MATLAB code and examples related to numerical calculations and analysis.
- The content covers a range of numerical methods and computational techniques applicable to engineering problems.

# 3. Other - Code (Educational)
- This directory contains additional educational MATLAB code covering fundamental concepts such as conditions, loops, and basic computations.
- Ideal for those seeking to enhance their MATLAB programming skills for engineering applications.

# 4. Statics - Computer Problems
- Explore MATLAB solutions for computer problems associated with the study of statics.
- This section provides computational solutions for static equilibrium problems, forces, and moments.
